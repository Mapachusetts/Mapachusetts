# Mapachusetts

A civic research site for Massachusetts candidates: search a candidate to see
cited summaries of their recent news coverage, funding, issue positions, career
history, sources, and common myths.

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) — frontend + API in one project
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (app) + Supabase (database)

## Routes

- `/` — landing page and the candidate research UI (search plus tabs for
  In the News, Funding, Career, Issues, Sources, and Myths & Facts)
- `/?candidate=<slug>` — opens a candidate's profile directly (shareable)
- `/news` — latest stored headlines, linking to the original reporting
- `/politicians/<slug>` — redirects to `/?candidate=<slug>`

## Where the data comes from

Each profile merges two sources by `slug` (see `lib/candidates.ts`):

- **Supabase** — `politicians` (name, office, party, bio, career history) and
  `politician_news_summaries` (AI-written summaries with numbered citations).
- **Curated profiles** — `lib/candidate-profiles.ts`, hand-written funding,
  issue, source, and myth data from the original candidate-search design.
  A profile without a Supabase row still appears in search.

Tabs with no data for a candidate show an empty state instead of hiding.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create the database

In the Supabase dashboard, open **SQL Editor → New query** and run, in order:

1. [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) — tables, indexes, Row Level
   Security (public read).
2. [`supabase/news_seed.sql`](supabase/news_seed.sql) — the 2026 statewide
   candidates and their cited news summaries (Oct 10–24, 2026).

`news_seed.sql` is generated from `supabase/seed-data/*.json`. After editing
those files, rebuild it with `node supabase/build-news-seed.mjs`, which also
validates the citations.

### 3. Environment variables

Values live in `.env` (gitignored):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon public key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service_role secret key>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<optional; only for npm run summarize>
```

- The URL and anon key are safe to expose to the browser.
- The `service_role` and Anthropic keys are secrets and are only used
  server-side. Never commit them or ship them to the browser.

### 4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Refreshing the news

- `npm run ingest` — pulls RSS headlines into `articles`.
- `npm run summarize` — fetches article text (kept in memory only), links
  articles to politicians by full name, and writes cited summaries. Needs
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- `npm run news` — both, in order.

Only headlines, links, short snippets, and summaries are stored, never full
article text.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, import the repo.
3. Add the environment variables above in the Vercel project settings.
4. Deploy.
